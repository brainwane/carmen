"Where on the Oregon Trail is Carmen Sandiego?" is a short, silly command-line game I am making basically because I have joked about it often enough.  It is licensed under the GNU Public License.

The player starts out in a town on the Oregon Trail and chases Carmen Sandiego, usually westward.  The player must make a few choices along the way, inferring from clues to guess where Carmen might have gone.

I do not currently plan to implement hunting, trading, dying of dysentery, variation in meal sizes and speed, any in-game time limit, river-fording, money, warrants, or a points system.  Also you do not need to consult the Broderbund almanac to level up, because there is no such thing as leveling up.
