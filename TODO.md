TODO
====

1. Text-wrap more of the exposition
1. Better clues & better clueing of what you're supposed to do
1. Additional stolen items
1. Separate presentation and logic (e.g., don't print in any of the choice steps)
1. Allow for different villain gender - perhaps look at Danielle Sucher's regendering Chrome plugin for ideas
1. Add a "press any key to continue" bit to space out some of the exposition
1. Maybe use a graph database for the cities -- or a dict?
1. Add difficulty levels - eventually initiate player in a non-Independence city
1. Figure out if I can match wordwrapping to size of player's terminal?
1. Change lists of destinations to SETS?!
1. Add a conception of "time" so that it makes sense for the player to have to make a choice: take the time to visit multiple clue sources within one city, or potentially skip useful information to catch up to the villain faster
